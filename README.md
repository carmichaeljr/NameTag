# NameTag
This is a simple program that is made for teachers. A student runs the script and it then displays there name in a small window in the corner of there screen. (The window is on top so they cannot cover it up.) It also has a bathroom button, with a countdown timer that starts a 4:30 to tell you how long the student was gone.
