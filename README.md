This is a simple program that is made for teachers. A student runs the script and it then displays there name in a small window in the corner of there screen. (The window is on top so they cannot cover it up.) It also has a bathroom button, with a countdown timer that starts a 4:30 to tell you how long the student was gone.

Python 3 or greater needs to be installed for this script to run. A file containing the users preferences will be created and stored in the documents folder.

This program has not been tested on linux or macOS, and was designed for Windows.
